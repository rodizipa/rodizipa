### Hello traveler, sit down and rest a bit ☕

My name is Rodrigo, I am an avid gamer and programmer. I enjoy learning new stuff. I am a generalist and usually my interests includes learning new languages, listening all kinds of music, learning history and geography, random facts, technology and reading (usually novels). I am Brazilian btw.

## TLDR

- 🌱 Currently learning about Istio service mesh and observabilities
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects I find interesting, recently interested in gaming modding.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with converting PDF tables to spreadsheet files
- 💬 Ask me about: Gacha games, mythology or the battle of porpoises
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord tag: `RodizipaZX#8984`, [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rodizipa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodizipa/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: The fact that I am a generalist means I have lot of unrelated knowledge that most of times I won't use anyway 😢
