### Hello traveler, sit down and rest!

My name is Rodrigo, I am an avid gamer and programmer. I enjoy learning new stuff. I am a generalist and usually my interests includes learning new languages, listening all kinds of music, learning history and geography, random facts, technology and reading (usually novels). I am Brazilian btw.

## TLDR
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an ETL/Notifications/Dashboards/Documents generator application called Orion
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects I find interesting, recently working with documents and fancy charts though.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with converting PDF tables into excel files
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Gacha games, mythology or Tomcat deployment
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord tag: `RodizipaZX#6264`, [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rodizipa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodizipa/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: The fact that I am a generalist means I have lot of unrelated knowledge that most of times I won't use anyway ðŸ˜¢

## Languages
- Brazilian Portuguese (native)
- English (Working on my pronounciation, but it is kinda advanced besides that)
- Japanese (N5 - Translates to very basic)
- Planning to learn Mandarin

## Stuff that I think I know the basics:
- CSS/Html/Javacript
- API Rest
- Java
- Python
- C
- Jenkins
- Git (Surprised?)
- Angular
- SQL (usually postgres or mysql, had my shenanigans with H2 recently though)
- Hibernate
- Maven
- Spring
- Docker
- Basic Message Service (Using ActiveMQ at moment)
- Discord API and bot shenanigans
