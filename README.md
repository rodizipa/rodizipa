### Hello traveler, sit down and rest!

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with converting PDF tables into excel files

- 📫 How to reach me: Discord tag: `RodizipaZX#6264`, [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rodizipa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodizipa/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: The fact that I am a generalist means I have lot of unrelated knowledge that most of times I won't use anyway 😢
